    p("The report emphasizes the health impact of using teargas and coward control weapons. Following the analysis, there were several takeaways. As the number of protests keeps rising in the future, it is a growing concern that crowd control weapons will become the new type of police brutality against the protestor. The table and the bar chart demonstrate the health consequences of overusing crowd control weapons on the individual, especially the potential long-lasting physical and psychological health effects and the lack of regulations. Therefore, it is time for us to reconsider the effectiveness of crowd control weapons to protect our freedom, our future, and our next generation.")
